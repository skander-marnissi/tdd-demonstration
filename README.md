Why Was My Repository Moved to Private?
If your repository has been moved to private and you're unsure why, donâ€™t worry! This change is part of new security policies designed to protect sensitive data and comply with external audit requirements.

What Triggers This Action?
Your repository may have been flagged for one or more of the following reasons:

Presence of Highly Sensitive Data
The repository contains unencrypted sensitive information, such as:

Identification credentials
API secrets or tokens
Classified Code
The repository includes code classified as:

C2 or C3 levels, as per internal security classification standards.
Why Was This Necessary?
This enforcement aligns with ECB audit requirements and broader security policies around continuous integration tools. To ensure compliance and protect critical information, repositories meeting the above criteria are automatically set to private.
