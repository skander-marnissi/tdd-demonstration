        <h2><b>What Triggers This Action?</b></h2>
        <p>Your repository may have been flagged for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Presence of Highly Sensitive Data</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The repository contains unencrypted sensitive information, such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identification credentials</li>
                        <li>API secrets or tokens</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>2. Classified Code</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The repository includes code classified as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C2 or C3 levels, according to the ASA/Masai assessment security classification standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2><b>Why Was This Necessary?</b></h2>
        <p>This action is taken to prevent serious risks that may arise from unprotected repositories, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sensitive Information Leaking:</b> Unintended exposure of credentials or classified data.</li>
            <li><b>Data Alteration:</b> Unauthorized changes to critical data or code.</li>
            <li><b>Rogue Trading:</b> Exploitation of unsecure repositories to manipulate systems maliciously.</li>
            <li><b>Payment System Fraud:</b> Potential misuse of financial operations or transaction data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These steps are aligned with <b>ECB audit requirements</b> and broader security policies around continuous integration tools. To ensure compliance and safeguard critical information, repositories meeting the above criteria are automatically set to private.
