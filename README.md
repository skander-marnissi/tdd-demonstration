## Why Was My Repository Moved to Private?

If your repository has been moved to private and you're unsure why, donâ€™t worry! This change is part of new security policies designed to protect sensitive data and comply with external audit requirements.

### What Triggers This Action?

Your repository may have been flagged for one or more of the following reasons:

1. **Presence of Highly Sensitive Data**  
   The repository contains unencrypted sensitive information, such as:  
   - Identification credentials  
   - API secrets or tokens  

2. **Classified Code**  
   The repository includes code classified as:  
   - **C2 or C3 levels**, as per internal security classification standards.

### Why Was This Necessary?

This action is taken to prevent serious risks that may arise from unprotected repositories, such as:  
- **Sensitive Information Leaking**: Unintended exposure of credentials or classified data.  
- **Data Alteration**: Unauthorized changes to critical data or code.  
- **Rogue Trading**: Exploitation of unsecure repositories to manipulate systems maliciously.  
- **Payment System Fraud**: Potential misuse of financial operations or transaction data.

These steps are aligned with **ECB audit requirements** and broader security policies around continuous integration tools. To ensure compliance and safeguard critical information, repositories meeting the above criteria are automatically set to private.
