Create product endpoint for:
    * creating products
    * getting all products

Create an order endpoint for:
    * creating order about a specific product:
        When order is created our app will check inventory through a specific api to confirm product availability,
        if available it will notify a broker to deliver product;
        if unavailable it will respond with a 'message product is unavailabe'
